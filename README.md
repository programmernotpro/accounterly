# accounterly
This is a project developed to track income and expenses. You just insert your income, then your expenses, and a graph appears. 

## BETA 0.1
This is the version Accounterly is currently on. This means that currently, accounterly has some basic functionality. Further versions **MAY** be released. 

### USE 
Accounterly has a form which you can fill. The expense and income fields are required, while the third field (currency) is not. 

#### OPEN SOURCE
Currently, the project is just for fun and will not accept any open-source collabs. Again, this **MAY** change in later versions, or once out of beta. 

##### TECH STACK 
-Vanilla JS
-HTML
